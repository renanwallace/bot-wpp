# bot-wpp

> bot-wpp is a javascript library which provides a high-level API control to Whatsapp so it can be configured to automatize resposes or any data that goes trough Whatsapp effortlessly. 
>
> It is built using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and based on [this python wrapper](https://github.com/mukulhase/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper)


## Installation

```bash
> npm i bot-wpp
```

## Usage

```javascript
// import { create, Whatsapp } from 'bot-wpp';
const bot = require('bot-wpp');

bot.create().then(client => start(client));

function start(client) {
  client.onMessage(message => {
    if (message.body === 'Hi') {
      client.sendText(message.from, 'ðŸ‘‹ Hello from bot!');
    }
  });
}
```

###### After executing `create()` function, **bot** will create an instance of whatsapp web. If you are not logged in, it will print a QR code in the [terminal](https://i.imgur.com/g8QvERI.png). Scan it with your phone and you are ready to go!
###### bot will remember the session so there is no need to authenticate everytime.
